# 🎵 Music Player Using Linked List (Python)

This project implements a **console-based Music Player** using **Python** and **Linked List data structures**.  
It focuses on core **data structure concepts** rather than graphical user interfaces.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The music player uses a **linked list** to manage songs dynamically.  
Each node represents a song, and operations such as play, next, previous, add, and delete songs are performed using linked list traversal.

This project is ideal for understanding:
- Linked Lists
- Pointers 
- Traversal operations
- Real-time data structure manipulation
